The great danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark." â€“Michelangelo

I wanted to share with all of you our Philosophy and mission at Certify Me.Online, a SAAS startup we founded a few months ago.

Certify Me. Online is an end-to-end solution for creating, issuing, and managing Digital Credentials.

As a philosophy, we believe that when our platform generates a credential we also generate a possibility of an extra smile on this planet.
Our mission is to become the most trusted credential platform and thus maximizing the number of smiles generated by end of 2023.

We would love it if you could be part of our humble journey. We are looking for Sales and Marketing Interns.

We don't take fixed salaries at Certify Me.Online we only take bonuses based on our performance. Hence sky is the limit .
