We are extremely proud and honored to be associated with  TEDxSantaTecla by enabling them with Digital Credentials for their upcoming events.

TEDxSantaTecla seeks to be a space that spreads and promotes great ideas. Their objective is to find those people who are generating a positive impact in their environment and allow them to share their ideas with the community. The theme for their next TEDxSantaTecla event is "Anatomy of Change" which is planned for August 28.2021, at Santa Tecla, El Salvador

TEDxSantaTecla is organized by entrepreneurs Carlos Polanco and Jos√© Ramos. Join me in wishing a grand success for all their upcoming events
