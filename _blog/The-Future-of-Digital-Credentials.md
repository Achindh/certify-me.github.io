#### What are Digital Credentials?
Digital credentials are credentials that certify the skills and achievements of an individual, issued by an entity other than a traditional school. The most common examples are badges, certificates, and diplomas.
Credentials could be issued in the form of digital badges or certificates that provide summaries of achievements to potential employers or educational institutions. They can also be used in the form of e-certificates given to students who complete particular tasks online. <br> <br>

#### Who issues the credentials?
The credentials are issued by the institution or program where the graduate has completed the requisite coursework for their degree. <br> <br>

#### Why does it matter?
Universities have traditionally been the gatekeepers of knowledge transfer. The problem with this model is that there are only so many universities, and it is exponentially difficult for students to get into them. What’s more, these institutions often don’t have time to review every application carefully. Digital credentials bypass this bottleneck by making education more accessible to everyone. <br> <br>

#### What are the barriers to digital credentials in higher education?
There is still a lack of awareness about the potential benefits of digital credentials in higher education. This includes credibility, degree completion, and retention rates. Digital degrees also need to be offered for free by institutions to increase their adoption rate.
