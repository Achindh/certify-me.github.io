# The Importance of Including Digital Credentials on LinkedIn


LinkedIn is a social networking platform intended for business professionals. The site's purpose is to allow registered users to create and document professional networks of people they know and trust. Professional network news feeds and a limited number of customisable modules are available on a LinkedIn member's profile page, which highlights talents, career history, and education.

Reid Hoffman, a former Executive Vice President in charge of business and corporate development at PayPal, co-founded LinkedIn. The site, which debuted in May 2003, now has over 300 million members from 200 countries and 170 industries. Reid Hoffman estimates that 27% of LinkedIn subscribers are recruiters.

LinkedIn was purchased by Microsoft in June 2016 for a whopping $26.2 billion. Some experts believe that the rich troves of semi-structured data that LinkedIn's members freely give away – job titles, geographies, industry information, skill sets – made the deal a steal, even though the LinkedIn acquisition was Microsoft's most expensive purchase to date.

## The Importance of Including Digital Credentials on LinkedIn:

With over 50 million organisations registered on Linkedin, it's a terrific way to get leads. LinkedIn has 310 million active monthly users worldwide as of June 2021. On the platform, there are 690 million professionals enrolled, with 60.1% in the 25-34 age range.

Linkedin's user base generates 9 billion content impressions and 280 billion feed views per year. As a result, it truly is an essential source for most businesses to raise brand awareness.

Employees should present their digital credentials on LinkedIn to boost their brand value and stimulate professional networking to receive the benefit of job listings or employment, especially because LinkedIn has such a large following in terms of numbers and data.

LinkedIn users develop networks of people with comparable talents, positions, work experiences, and interests by connecting with relevant professionals, colleagues, and acquaintances. The issuer increases visibility for their brand, programmes, and qualifications when they add a digital certificate or digital badge to their profile. This increases engagement and opens the door to new sign-ups and interest in training, membership, and programmes.

## How to Integrate Digital Badges and Certificates into LinkedIn:

LinkedIn is an excellent platform for building their portfolios and resumes by including their qualifications, employment history, work experience, recognitions, publications, and, most importantly, displaying certifications and badges.

## Adding Digital badges and Digital Certificates on LinkedIn:

Users can add and share their Digital Credentials in two ways: through posts and by adding them to their profile.

When a user earns Digital Credentials, they are redirected to a sharing page that allows them to share their achievements across all digital platforms, including LinkedIn. You only need to do the following:

Click the 'Share' button.
Select LinkedIn from the list of 30 +social media platforms.
You will be taken to the LinkedIn feed.
Include a caption / messaage
Click on the post

It should be noted that sharing will allow the Digital Credential's media to be shared on the LinkedIn feed in the form of images or videos. These credentials can also be shared via LinkedIn messaging.

Users can also add their Digital Credentials to their LinkedIn profile by clicking the 'Add to LinkedIn' button; the credential will then appear on the profile under Licenses and certifications. These certifications can also be manually added to one's LinkedIn profile.

LinkedIn also allows users to share their profiles with a unique link or URL that can be shared and added to their resumes or portfolios.
